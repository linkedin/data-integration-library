# Work Unit

"Time" watermarks can generate partitions, and "unit" watermarks have units. 

Time watermark and unit watermark together creates work units, and DIL 
maintains execution state including watermarks for each work unit. 

Partitions and Units make a matrix. Assuming we have m periods and n units, 
the matrix will be n x m. **Each combination of partitions and units makes 
a work unit**. That means there will be n x m work units. 

The following scenarios are possible:

- Only time watermark is defined, no secondary input nor explicit unit 
watermark, and time watermark is **not partitioned**, 
there will be only 1 work unit 
- Only time watermark is defined, no secondary input nor explicit unit 
watermark, and time watermark is partitioned into **m partitions**, 
there will be m work units
- Only unit watermark is defined, either through secondary input or 
through explicit definition, default none-partition time watermark, 
there will be n work units
- Both time watermark and unit watermark are defined, there will 
be n x m work units

In any of above cases, each work unit tracks its own high watermark.
